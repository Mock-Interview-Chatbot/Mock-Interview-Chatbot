Label,Ans
Right,A linked list is the most sought after data structure when it comes to handling dynamic data elements
Right,A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory
Wrong,Confused with the answer
Wrong,Not sure
Right,Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory
Right,A linked list is a sequence of data structures which are connected together via links
Wrong,Not sure
Right,Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array
Right,It's the same as the list used in high-level language like python
Right,Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items where each link contains a connection to another link
Wrong,Not sure
Wrong,I dont really know
Wrong,Wrong guess
Right,Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes where every node points to the next node
Right,To access an element in a linked list we need to traverse every element until we reach the desired element
Right,Elements are accessed sequentially in linked list
Right, Random access of elements is not an allowed in linked list
Right,To implement file system for separate chaining in hash-tables and to implement non-binary trees linked lists are used
Wrong,Time must be spent traversing and changing the pointers
Right,It’s a set of structures ordered not by their physical placement in memory but by logical links that are stored as a part of the info within the structure itself
Right,A linked list is another way to collect similar data
Wrong,Binary search is not inefficient with linked list
Right,Linked lists are sequence of pointers which do not require extra space
Right,Linear data structures like stacks and queues are also sometimes defined to be linked list
